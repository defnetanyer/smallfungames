This python file is some stuff I work on while I travel to and from university. I live in Victoria, BC so I spend at least 10 hours travelling every term.
I decided to use that time and just do some small codes while on air.
They are simple because I do not have access to any wifi on the plane, so all of these were done from scratch without any use of internet.

I like coding these, so that I can play them on my free time. I have plans of implementing discord.py module to this so I can play it on discord with friends!
You can take these if you want I dont mind :D

Currently the file includes:
- a square root function
- magic 8 ball
- rock paper scissors
- hangman

My plan is to write a card game next... blackjack or uno. I have until december when I'm travelling to decide.
